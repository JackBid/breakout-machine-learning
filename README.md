# Breakout Machine Learning

This project explores machine learning in the context of the Atari game breakout. The game is simulated using the [OpenAi Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit, this also provides an interface into the game providing observations and rewards at each timestep. Machine learning is achieved using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Currently, a supervised agent is trained using the ball's coordinates and the paddle's X coordinate. 

## Current Features
